# Air Quality Locations

Data visualization of local air quality powered by OpenAQ's API
[OpenAQ Home](https://openaq.org/#/)
[OpenAQ Api Docs](https://docs.openaq.org/#/v2/summary_get_v2_summary_get)

## Goal

Visualize entities of "community" from OpenAQ's /v2/locations endpoint, where one group are communities with at least one measurement based on µg/m³ and is >= 5 µg/m³, and the other group that didn't meet the criteria
